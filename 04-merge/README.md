# Exercise 04: The Clean Merge

### The Scenario
While you were updating the website footer on the `main` branch, your colleague was working on a new login system in the `feature-login` branch. Her work is now tested and approved. You need to combine her new files into your main codebase so the project is up to date for the next release.

### Your Task
Integrate the changes from `feature-login` into your current `main` branch.

### Expected Output
- The file `login.html` should appear in your directory.
- `git log` should show a merge commit combining both histories.
