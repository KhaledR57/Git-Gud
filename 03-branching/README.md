# Exercise 03: Branching

### The Scenario
You need to develop a new feature without messing up the stable code on `main`.

### Your Task
1. Create a new branch named `feature-idea`.
2. Switch to that branch.
3. Create a new file named `idea.txt` and commit it with the message `feat: add new idea`.

### Expected Output
- You should be on the `feature-idea` branch.
- `idea.txt` should exist and be committed.
